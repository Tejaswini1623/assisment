Steps to Complete the Project
Dockerization:

Create Dockerfile:
Define the base image.
Copy application files.
Install dependencies.
Set the entry point.

Kubernetes Deployment:
Write Kubernetes Manifests:
Deployment manifest:
Define the application deployment.
Specify the Docker image and tag.
Set resource requests and limits.
Service manifest:
Define the service type (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).
Expose the application on necessary ports.

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
Implement GitHub Actions Workflow:
Define jobs for building the Docker image.
Push the image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).
Challenge Goal: Create additional jobs to deploy the updated image to the Kubernetes cluster.

TLS Implementation:
   Setup TLS:
   Generate TLS certificates.
Configure the Kubernetes Ingress or Service to use TLS.
Ensure the application is accessible over HTTPS.
